In the context of Psychology, *intensive longitudinal data (ILD)* are data that consist of many repeated measures for multiple units (e.g., more than 25 repeated measures for multiple persons), for one or more variables. These data are typically collected through self-report with repeatedly administered smart phone surveys, through observation, or through real time trackers. For now, MATILDA focuses mainly on self-report ILD, collected via surveys.

Data that consist of many repeated measures for a single unit and variable is called a <i>time series</i>. In other words, ILD consist of time series for multiple persons (or other units, such as dyads or teams), for one or more variables. In practice however, sometimes ILD is also used to refer to the time series of one person.

This type of data stands in contrast with other common data types in Psychology, such as <i> cross-sectional data </i> and <i> panel data </i>. Cross-sectional data consist of scores measured at a single time points for many persons. Panel data consist of a few repeated measures, for many persons.
