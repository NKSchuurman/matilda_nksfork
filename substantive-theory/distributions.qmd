# Distributions: A Key Consideration for Measuring ILD

To illustrate the importance of considering the distribution of a process, consider:

a.  Consideration a

b.  Consideration b

c.  Consideration c


## Think More About Distributions

There are many things to consider with respect to substantive theory, measurement theory, and measurement design that relate to distributions. We have collected various topics for you to read more about below.
