However, at second glance the researcher encounters a problem: When measuring “How hardworking are you right now?”, not all measurement occasions are equally important, as there simply is not a lot of work to do during weekends or in the evening. Therefore, the researcher includes a situational variable S into the procedure, and couples the assessment of Y to positive responses on S.

As such, being not at all sad is equivalent to being neither happy nor sad. In this case, measuring one half of the latent construct with a unipolar scale can be thought of as systematically left-sensoring the data. As Falcaro et al. (2013, p. 12) put it:\n\nThe depression score variable in this study suffered a marked floor effect at 0. We decided to treat this as a special case of interval censoring. Under this model we are assuming that those who score at the floor of the test could have been further differentiated into varying levels of non-depression if there had been appropriate additional items. Most people would call such variation in non-depression variation in happiness but, in the absence of actual happiness items and evidence of their tapping the same dimension as the depression items, the labelling of any such implicit variability is best left open.\n\n\n\nC.

It has been suggested that dietary intake (Ruf et al., 2021), smoking behavior (Liu, 2007), and certain affective processes (Lu et al., 2019) might be better explained in this framework.

    "text": "Multiple items for reasons of reliability\nHaving multiple items to measure the same construct can be helpful, because it allows using internal consistency reliability approaches. For these techniques, the general idea is that the items all measure the same underlying construct. The shared variance among those items is the result of variation in the true construct, while the unshared variance among the items is considered measurement error.\nMultiple items that measure the same construct, combined with internal consistency reliability approaches can be used to\na) estimate the reliability of (a set of) items for measuring a construct of interest. That is, to validate a questionnaire.\nb) in order to account for measurement error for a construct of interest during an analysis. That is, to prevent measurement error from biasing the results of analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Social Support 3\n\n\n\n\n\nUme has developed a short experience-sampling questionnaire where three items are used to measure daily experienced received social support. The items are “I felt supported by others today…”, “I felt grateful to others today…” and “Other people had my back today…”. The shared variance in the items over time is considered variance in the ‘true’ received social support, and the unique variance in the items over time is considered measurement error.\n\n\n\nWell-known internal consistency approaches for interindividual (e.g., cross-sectional) studies are reliability measures such as Cronbach’s Alpha, and latent variable models such as factor models and Item Response Theory models. These techniques cannot be used directly on intensive longitudinal data, but extensions and similar alternatives are available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Social Support 4\n\n\n\n\n\nUme uses a reflective linear factor model with the three items as indicators, and one latent variable that should reflect ‘received social support’. They use the model to estimate the reliability for their short questionnaire, as part of their validation study. Reliability will be high when the items consistently increase and decrease together over the repeated measures (if they covary a lot of time).\nIf the questionnaire is deemed valid based on Ume’s study, in future studies researchers can use the same factor model to correct for measurement error in their analyses.\n\n\n\nWhen using multiple items for reliability purposes, it is important to realize\n\nthat each internal consistency reliability technique is based on theoretical assumptions, and hence has theoretical implications.

    "section": "Multiple Items to Mirror Interindividual Difference Questionnaires",
    "text": "Multiple Items to Mirror Interindividual Difference Questionnaires\nResearchers may want to use constructs established in interindividual difference research for intra-individual difference studies using ILD: For example, constructs such as ‘positive affect’ or ‘introversion’. In that case, the first intuition may be to simply take the questionnaires from inter-individual difference research and adapt them to the intra-individual context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: PANAS 1\n\n\n\n\n\nA researcher wants to measure intra-individual differences in ‘Positive Affect’ and ‘Negative Affect’, constructs established in the context of individual differences research. It is commonly measured with the PANAS Schedule (refs). It measures how much positive and negative affect people tend to generally experience, and is used to study trait differences between people in how much positive and negative affect the tend to experience, and how this relates to other differences between people (e.g., their sex or personality traits).\nThe researcher takes the original items of the PANAS scale, and but changes the phrasing to suit intra-individual difference research.\nFor example: The original PANAS instructions were “Indicate the extent you have felt this way over the past week.” for various adjectives (e.g., “irritable”, “guilty”, “afraid”), rated on a 5 point likert scale (“very slightly/not at all” - “extremely”). The researcher changes the instruction to “Indicate the extent you have felt this way in the last hour.”, keeping the remaining the same.\n\n\n\nIt is important to consider the following:\n\nconstructs established interindividual difference research may be less relevant, or irrelevant for studying intra-individual differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample PANAS 2\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on interindividual difference research, the items “irritable”, “guilty”, “afraid” (and others) are considered suitable items for establishing consistent differences in ‘overall negative affect’ among different people (refs). Based on factor modeling studies, it has been established that people that tend to overall feel more irritable than other people, tend to also feel more guilty and afraid than other people. This property is captured in a latent variable, which is considered to capture differences in people’s overall ‘negative affect’.\nIf we carry over the ‘negative affect’ latent variable to intra-individual differences over time, using on the same adjectives as the original scale, we would need to establish the following pattern over time: If a person feels relatively irritable at a certain occasion, that person tends to also feel relatively guilty and afraid at that same occasion.\nConsider, however, that actually whether a person feels irritable at a given occassion, and whether the person also feels guilty and afraid, depends mainly on the context the participant is in at that occasion. For some experiences (participant is publicly called out on a big mistake) they may feel all three emotions to a large extent, while for other experiences (participant encounters an angry swarm of bees during a walk) they may be inclined to feel mostly one of them.\nIf so, the concept of general negative effect may turn out not so directly relevant for studying how people’s emotions fluctuate over time (intra-individual differences); while it is very suitable for studying general tendencies of people compared to other people (interindividual differences).\n\n\n\n\nquestionnaires for intra-individual difference studies, often need to have different qualities than questionnaires on inter-individual differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: PANAS 3\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the PANAS adjective ‘guilty’, for which participants now would “Indicate the extent you have felt this way in the last hour.” If one collects relatively few repeated measures over a short time span, participants may often or even always respond ‘not at all/very slightly’ for the majority of measures. This would result in little to no within-person variance in the repeated measures of guilt, making intra-individual difference analyses difficult or impossible.\nIn comparison, for studying (stable) interindividual differences or traits, the timing of measurements is often less important compared to getting a representative varied sample of participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: PANAS 4\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the original PANAS for interindividual differences consists of 20 items, we may prefer a shorter questionnaire for an intra-individual difference study where we collect repeated measures every hour.\n\n\n\n\nvalid and reliable questionnaires from inter-individual difference research, may not be valid and reliable for intra-individual difference research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: PANAS 5\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the original PANAS for interindividual differences may have a reliability between .8-.9 (refs), an adapted PANAS for intra-individual differences may have a much lower or higher reliability (Schuurman & Hamaker, 2019).\n\n\n\nHence, questionnaires or items adapted from interindividual difference research need to be completely re-validated.\nWe generally recommend to avoid copying constructs from interindividual research directly to intra-individual difference studies unless there are very good theoretical reasons to do so. That is, the constructs need to make sense for studying intra-individual differences, for the given research question, and context, preferably backed by empirical evidence. In many cases it may be more fruitful to establish (new) constructs tailored to intra-individual differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Interindividual vs intraindividual differences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntra-individual versus Interindividual Difference Studies"

Leveraging these assumptions, the two sources of variance can be distinguished from each other, and we can estimate the reliability of an approach.\nBelow we will discuss two methods that do this, and can be used for measurements of single items and single (or multiple) participants: The measurement error autoregressive model and the immediate test-retest method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Other approaches to reliability (for muliple item measures)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Internal Consistency Reliability]"

In that case, all parts of the ongoing process are captured by exactly one measurement frame.\n\n\nAlternatively, the time frame may be shorter than the time interval between the measurements. This tends to be the case when using the momentary time frame (i.e., ‘’right now’’), but is also quite common in panel research. In the latter case, the time frame is often determined by the instrument that is used and that has been validated with that particular specification. In these cases, there is a proportion of the process that is not covered by any of the measurements.\n\nIt also happens that the time frame is actually longer than the time interval between measurements; in that case the time frames overlap. A typical case is when participants are asked to rate themselves ‘’in general’’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: ESM/EMA study\n\n\n\n\n\nPia is using ESM/EMA to study fluctuations in anxiety throughout the day. She is asking participants to indicate how anxious they feel right now, at random time points throughout the day.

    "text": "Three Key Considerations\nWhen studying the relation between multiple constructs with different measurement frequencies, it is important to consider three key points:\na) The relation between these constructs may not be straightforward. It is important to carefully think about how one construct relates to the other, and more specifically when. Does the construct always affect the other, or does it only occur at a specific time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Sleep quality and positive affect 2\n\n\n\n\n\nBatu believes that a person’s sleep quality only influences their positive affect in the morning and early afternoon. During the day, the effect of sleep quality on positive affect wears off.\n\n\n\nb) Different measurements may refer to different time points or intervals. It is important to consider to what time point or interval a measurement refers to, in order to concretely hypothesize about the dynamic relations between variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Sleep quality and positive affect 3\n\n\n\n\n\nBatu measures sleep quality in the morning at the same time of the first measurement of positive affect. However, the measurement of sleep quality refers to the preceding night, which is an interval of time that happens before the measurement is taken. The items for positive affect refer to how the participant feels at the moment and therefore refer to that specific measurement occasion.\n\n\n\nc) Aggregation of measurements (e.g., averages) may lead to different theoretical interpretations. It is important to consider the difference between measurements and aggregated measurements with regards to the substantive interpretation of the relations between variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Sleep quality and positive affect 4\n\n\n\n\n\nGulce is interested in a similar relation as Batu between sleep quality and positive affect.

Each item refers to how the participants feel at the moment. E.g., “I feel satisfied at the moment”.\n\n\n\nImplicitly lagged measurements are measures that refer to a previous time point or interval, and are therefore inherently lagged: The time stamp of the measurement occasion is not the time point or interval which the measurement refers to. In contrast to explicitly lagged variables, the lag is not the interval between time stamps of the measurement, but the interval between the time indications of the measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Positive affect 2\n\n\n\n\n\nMark set up an ESM study where participants receive positive affect items every hour. However, each item refers to how the participants have felt in the past hour. E.g., “In the past hour, I felt satisfied”.\n\n\n\nWhen considering only one variable, the difference in lag interpretation between implicitly and explicitly lagged measurements is trivial. Yet, when considering multiple variables, it is important to think about the lag interpretation between these variables. Both variables could be measured at the same time, but refer to a different time point or interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Sleep quality and positive affect 3\n\n\n\n\n\nBatu measures sleep quality in the morning at the same time of the first measurement of positive affect.
